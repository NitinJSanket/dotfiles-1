### Download Ubuntu-16.04 for XU4 from: `https://odroid.in/ubuntu_16.04lts/`

1. Un-xz your image file: 
`unxz ubuntu-16.04-mate-odroid-xu3-20160708.img.xz`

2. Insert your micro-SD Card to your host PC. Make sure that it's more than 8GB. *Minimum 16GB is recommended.*
*(The size of Ubuntu mate image is around 4GB and Opencv requires around 2.5GB)*

3. Copy the Image into SD card. 
Replace `sdX` to your SD card device name in your host machine.
*NOTE: Recheck your SD Card partition. Do not enter any other HDD partition by mistake, else you'll lose the HDD data. Check `lsblk` to confirm your partition. *
```
sudo dd if=ubuntu-16.04-mate-odroid-xu4-$version.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
sync
```

4. Install Gparted on your host and run
(Resize `rootfs` partition as it is just 4GB in the image)
```
sudo apt-get install gparted
sudo gparted
```

5. Select `/dev/sdX` on `gparted` and in the `rootfs`. Right-Click, resize and set max size of sdcard.

6. Insert this SD Card on the Odroid XU4 and turn the power on.
*Make sure the Odroid switch is pointing towards microSD (not eMMC). 

7. Log-in with 
```
username: odroid
password: odroid
```

8. Download and install `opencv_install_odroid.sh`
```
source opencv_install_to_ubuntu_mate_16.04.sh
```

9. Sample Test:
```
cd opcv-2.13.xx/samples/c
./facedetect lena.jpg
```
